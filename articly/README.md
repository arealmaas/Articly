===================================

Look, I get it. You're sitting there thinking "Do I really need more marshmallows in my life?"
YES. Yes, you absolutely do. Here's why:

1. They're basically clouds you can eat. When was the last time you ate a cloud? Never? Exactly.

2. They're the perfect stress ball AND snack. Try squeezing a banana when you're stressed. It won't end well.

3. Scientific studies* have shown that people who eat marshmallows are 73% more likely to smile while doing taxes.

4. They're the only food that can transform from regular size to GIANT size with just a microwave. 
   Try that with broccoli. Actually, don't.

5. They're basically a vegetable** - they grow on marshmallow trees***, right?
